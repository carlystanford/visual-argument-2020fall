For the current draft of my visual argument, I have decided to focus on establishing the environmental benefits of going meatless just one day a week. This is a different idea than the one introduced in my proposal,
which was focused on encouraging people to buy local food. When searching for assets and images for my previous idea, I didn't find anything that really resonated with me and couldn't think 
of any good ideas to actually arrange an argument. I personally care a lot about sustainable agriculture
and sustainable diets, and have decided to cut out meat from my own diet for environmental reasons. I initially shed
away from any sort of argument involving persuading peolpe not to eat meat as I don't want to be one of those annoying
vegetarians, but I also don't believe that it's right for everyone. So, I though informing people of the environmental benefits
of cutting back on meat for just one day a week was a happy medium. 
</br>As far as the arrangement of my visual argument, I started with the statistic that skipping one serving of beef every
Monday for one year saves the same emissions as driving 348 miles in a car. I made this sort of like a headline, with the lines 
descending in width to draw your eye down to the diagram below. I also decided to make the last line, which states "saves the equivalent
emissions of driving 348 miles in a car" in red to contrast from the other text and add emphasis to the one 
particular line, as I find it to be the most important. Below is a diagram depicting a hamburger and a map of Pennsylvania and New Jersery,
with a dotted line across the states to symbolize the distance of 348 miles. 348 miles is approximately equivalent to a 5 and a half hour
road trip from New Jersey to Pittsburgh, as stated in the line below. The third segment has simple text that reads "do your part. #MeatlessMonday" to wrap up the overall message of the argument, which is to persuade people to go meatless for just one day a week. One of the last elements I decided on 
adding in was the blocks of color segmenting the image into three parts. I wanted to do this to play a bit on the idea of negative and postive space, and 
I felt like with one solid color background it looked a little messy. I think I like this color blocking element for the top two blocks of the piece, 
with the statistic and the diagram, but I'm still unsure how it looks in the third bottom segment. I think there's too much space in the bottom segment
and it is denser when compared with the top two so it looks a little off, so I may still play around with that to see if I can get it to a point where I 
like it.
