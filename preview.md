For the current draft of my visual argument, I have decided to focus on establishing the environmental benefits of going meatless just one day a week. This is a different idea than the one introduced in my proposal,
which was focused on encouraging people to buy local food. When searching for assets and images for my previous idea, I didn't find anything that really resonated with me and couldn't think 
of any good ideas to actually arrange an argument. I personally care a lot about sustainable agriculture
and sustainable diets, and have decided to cut out meat from my own diet for environmental reasons. I initially shed
away from any sort of argument involving persuading peolpe not to eat meat as I don't want to be one of those annoying
vegetarians, but I also don't believe that it's right for everyone. So, I though informing people of the environmental benefits
of cutting back on meat for just one day a week was a happy medium. 
</br>As far as the arrangement of my visual argument, I started with the statistic that skipping one serving of beef every
Monday for one year saves the same emissions as driving 348 miles in a car. I made this sort of like a headline, with the lines 
descending in width to draw your eye down to the diagram below. I also decided to make the last line, which states "saves the equivalent
emissions of driving 348 miles in a car" in red to contrast from the other text and add emphasis to the one 
particular line, as I Fidn it to be the most important. Below is a diagram depicting a hamburger and a map of Pennsylvania and New Jersery,
with a dotted line across the states to symbolize the distance of 348 miles. 348 miles is approximately equivalent to a 5 and a half hour
road trip from New Jersey to Pittsburgh, which I plan to also state in the text somewhere below the diagram.
This draft is definitely incomplete, as I plan to include a bit more text on the bottom part of the page below the map diagram, and am still
playing around with font and text styles for the existing text.
