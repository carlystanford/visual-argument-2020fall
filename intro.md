# #MeatlessMonday
For my visual argument, I've decided to focus on the environmental benefits of a cutting back on meat consumption for just one day. This is otherwise known as #MeatlessMonday, a movement that has gained some traction in recent years due to sustainability concerns of animal agriculture. If everyone contributes their small 
part, the Earth will be better off for it!
